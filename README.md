# Calendar
A time-based calendar app for typical work-day scheduling

The calendar app uses local storage to let a user save hourly tasks to the scheduling app. The app
also uses Moment API to dynamically set the current date/time. Comparing the time from moment to the
hard-coded time blocks (set to typical 9-5 work day hours), the hourly input row changes color to
designate past hours, the current hour, and future hours.

This project was particularly useful for helping me to understand and practice this. It also helped
me to start to understand how to use local storage.
